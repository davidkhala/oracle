# design
Oracle GoldenGate creates trail files that contain the most recent changed data from the source database.

It then pushes these files to the server, where a process converts the trail file into standard SQL to be applied to the target database.
## Compared to Oracle DB Data Guard
- DG simply maintains an exact **physical** replica of the production copy remotely. Thus it has to be **homogenous** and only between oracle to oracle
- Only one-way data replication
- DB is simpler than Goldengate in aspects
  - Configure: itâ€™s very transparent to operate
  - Restrictions: It has no data type restrictions. There are no requirements for supplemental logging.
  - The need for performance tuning is also zero to none at the standby database.
- Performance: there are no performance implications for tables without a unique index or primary key with Data Guard.
- worse to meet RTO than Goldengate
